<!--     For file downloads (sponsorship pack, assessment sheets, it's good to add a note showing that it'll be a download so users aren't surprised they are suddenly downloading an unknown file. Also, for the PDF, it's 8MB so it's good practice to put a note about how big the file is so they can anticipate a longer download. -->
